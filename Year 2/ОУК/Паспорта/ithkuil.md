Has multiple diphthongs
Uses pitch accent to separate words but isn't tonal
Penultimate stress (stressing syllable-before-last) is unmarked, non-penultimate stresses are marked as follows: a vowel with no diacritic takes the acute accent (e.g., á, ó, etc.);  a vowel with a dieresis changes it to a circumflex accent (e.g., **ö → ô**)
