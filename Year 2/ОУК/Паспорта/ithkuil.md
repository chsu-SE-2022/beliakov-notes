Ithkuil's official documentation has [several paragraphs](https://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_01_phonology.htm) for pronunciations of less frequent sounds, partly because some of them aren't part of IPA
## Stress
Ithkuil has penultimate (syllable-before-last) for most cases, and non-penultimate stresses are marked with a diacritic
## Tone/pitch
Penultimate stress (stressing syllable-before-last) is the default and is unmarked, non-penultimate stresses are marked as follows: a vowel with no diacritic takes the acute accent (e.g., á, ó, etc.);  a vowel with a dieresis changes it to a circumflex accent (e.g., ö → ô)
# Writing system
Ithkuil uses a unique, morpho-phonemic writing system, where graphic characters display phonological and morphological information. It is incredibly complex, which is why many prefer using romanized version of Ithkuil.
Written words can be separated into:
- Primary character
- Secondary characters
- Rotated secondary characters
- Tertiary characters
- Quarternary characters
## Primary characters
Primary characters initiate the word and show the majority of the information: specification, context, relation, concatenation status, perspective, extension, configuration, affiliation, essence, stem, function, version and plexity of the word.
![Example of a primary character](Pasted%20image%2020231114224054.png)
## Secondary characters
Secondary characters follow the primary character and show consonantal information for affixes in slots 3, 5 and 7. They can also be rotated laterally by 180 degrees, in which case they show slot 7 affixes.
## Tertiary characters
Tertiary characters are composite and are placed after all secondary characters. They indicate Valence, Aspect, Phase, Effect and Level of the word
## Quarternary characters
Quarternary characters are placed right after tertiary characters and are used for displaying case, case-scope, illocution+validation and mood. Quarternary characters can use diacritics to show case-scope and mood

Each slot has specific morphological and semantic functions.
## Affixes
Affixes show degrees and gradients
### Gradient types
Gradients of newness, familiarity, fluctiation, repetition frequency, effectiveness, relative time, timeliness
## Adjuncts
### Affixes
Single-affix, multi-affix
#### Modular adjuncts
Consists of 2-4 parts
Part 1 - what adjunct applies to
Part 2 - Valence/Phase/Level/Effect + Mood/Case-scope OR Aspect+Mood/Case-scope
Part 3 = Part 2
Part 4 depends on Part 2, 3 and stress: **Aspect** or **Valence/Phase/Level/Effect** or **Specialized Scope of the Adjunct**
#### Register Adjuncts
Indicate the mode of personal communication of the word:
Narrative, Discursive (quote, direct speech), Parenthetical (parenthesis), Specificative (Proper name of referent), Exeplificative (example), Cogitant (silent thoughts), Carrier-end
#### Suppletive Adjuncts
These adjuncts imply case-scope information
#### Bias adjuncts
These adjuncts operate like interjections and establish a tone the speaker has towards the topic of discussion
# Sociolinguistic and historic characteristics
Ithkuil is mostly influenced by the idea of systematization of grammatical concepts to precisely express information, something natural languages generally cannot do. Ithkuil tries to take best parts of natural languages while tying them to this idea
# Developed levels
Ithkuil is developed on all levels, as it has its own morphology, grammar, syntax rules and also a reading and writing system
# Visual representation
